Robo Speaker: This Python program is designed to transform text into speech, functioning as a simple, voice-responsive assistant.
It allows users to input text, which the Robo Speaker will then read out loud using synthesized voice technology. 
Created using Python, it utilizes the pyttsx3 library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library that works offline and provides multiple voice customization options,
including pitch, speed, and volume adjustments.

Key Features:
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts any user input text into spoken words.
Voice Customization: Adjusts the voice rate and volume, and offers both male and female voices.
Offline Capability: Works without the need for an internet connection.
Python Library Integration: Uses pyttsx3 for speech synthesis, allowing cross-platform functionality on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
